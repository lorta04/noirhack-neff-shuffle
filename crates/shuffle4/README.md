# 🔀 shuffle4

This circuit applies **ElGamal encryption and shuffling** to a deck of 4 cards. It allows a player to randomly permute and re-encrypt the deck using their randomness while preserving the integrity of the original card set.

It’s used in collaborative shuffling protocols, where each player hides the original card positions using encryption and a permutation matrix.

## 🔧 How It Works

Given:

- `g: Field` — Generator of the group
- `agg_pk: Field` — Aggregate public key shared by all players
- `deck: [[Field; 2]; 4]` — The current state of the 4-card deck (plaintext or encrypted)
- `rand: [Field; 4]` — Per-card randomness used to re-encrypt each card
- `perm: [[Field; 4]; 4]` — 4×4 permutation matrix indicating how cards are shuffled

The circuit outputs:

- `shuffled_deck: [[Field; 2]; 4]` — A new, re-encrypted and permuted deck

```
for i in 0..4 {
    encrypted_card = encrypt(g, agg_pk, deck[i], rand[i]);
    encrypted_deck[i][0] = encrypted_card[0];
    encrypted_deck[i][1] = encrypted_card[1];
}
shuffled_deck = mul_NxN_by_Nx2(perm, encrypted_deck);
```

## ✅ Example Inputs

```
g = "3"
agg_pk = "17"
deck = [
  ["1", "10"],
  ["1", "20"],
  ["1", "30"],
  ["1", "40"]
]
rand = ["77", "88", "99", "111"]
perm = [
  ["1", "0", "0", "0"],
  ["0", "1", "0", "0"],
  ["0", "0", "1", "0"],
  ["0", "0", "0", "1"]
]
```

participant S as Server

participant P1 as Player 1

participant P2 as Player 2

participant P4 as Player 4



S->>P1: Send plaintext deck



P1->>P1: Run shuffle4 (encrypt + permute)

P1->>S: Return encrypted deck



S->>P2: Send encrypted deck

P2->>P2: Run shuffle4

P2->>S: Return encrypted deck



S->>P4: ...

P4->>P4: Run shuffle4

P4->>S: Return final encrypted deck



note over All: Final encrypted deck is public

note over All: Each player receives deck[i - 1] as their card

```

## 📝 Notes

- **Only Player 1 sees the plaintext deck**. All subsequent players only see and permute the encrypted version.
- The permutation matrix must be a valid permutation (only one `1` per row and column).
- The randomness ensures ciphertext unlinkability between shuffle rounds.

This process is repeated in order for all `4` players, resulting in a collaboratively encrypted and shuffled deck where **no one knows the original position of any card**.
